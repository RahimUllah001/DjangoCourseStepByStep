# Using Q Objects for Complex Queries in Django

Django provides the **Q objects** to allow for more complex queries that involve multiple conditions, including the use of logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`). This is especially useful when you need to filter records based on multiple conditions that can't be expressed easily with keyword arguments alone.

## Basic Use of Q Objects

You can use `Q` objects from `django.db.models` to build complex queries by chaining conditions with logical operators.

### Importing Q

To use `Q` objects, you need to import them from `django.db.models`.

```python
from django.db.models import Q
```

## Example: Applying `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` in Queries

Here are some examples demonstrating how to use `Q` objects with logical operators.

### AND Operation

To filter records that match **both** conditions, you use `&` (AND) between two `Q` objects.

```python
student_data = Student.objects.filter(Q(id=4) & Q(roll=104))
```

This will return students where the `id` is 4 **and** the `roll` number is 104.

### OR Operation

To filter records that match **either** of the conditions, you use `|` (OR) between two `Q` objects.

```python
student_data = Student.objects.filter(Q(id=4) | Q(roll=105))
```

This will return students where either the `id` is 4 **or** the `roll` number is 105.

### NOT Operation

To exclude certain records, you use the `~` (NOT) operator to negate a condition.

```python
student_data = Student.objects.filter(~Q(id=4))
```

This will return all students except the ones where the `id` is 4.

## Views

Hereâ€™s how you can use these Q object queries inside a Django view.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Student
from django.db.models import Q

def home(request):
    # Applying AND operation
    student_data = Student.objects.filter(Q(id=4) & Q(roll=104))
    
    # Applying OR operation
    student_data = Student.objects.filter(Q(id=4) | Q(roll=105))
    
    # Applying NOT operation
    student_data = Student.objects.filter(~Q(id=4))

    context = {'students': student_data}
    return render(request, 'home.html', context)
```

## Conclusion

Q objects in Django are a powerful tool for building complex queries that involve multiple conditions with logical operators. They help you express queries that would otherwise be cumbersome or impossible using simple keyword arguments in `filter()`.

By using `Q`, you can write more flexible and readable queries that handle complex business logic.
